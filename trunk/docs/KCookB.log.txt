[Geral]
	The software must manage cooking recipes as if a it whore a book. It should 
	be easy to use and to manage.

[Info to store]
	Name;
	Ingredients;

[Features]
	- Schedule system where one could create a schedule for the comming week.
	- Should provide export capabilities to:	
		* XML
		* SQL
		* CSV
	- Should allow export based on templates (HTML)
	- Should have some import capabilites.
	- Should be prepared for i18n
	- As the data is not all stored in the same file care must be taken in order 
	for the user to understand that a given group of files represents a catalog.
	In that order the should exist an icon for the folder where the catalog is
	stored, such folder should have the same name as the catalog and a tool 
	should be created to zip the contents of the catalog folder.
	More, a filter should be implemented so that only catalog folders are 
	recognized in the open/save file dialogs
	- It should be possible to search recipes on various terms.

[Implementation]
	- Will use Db40 as the database engine and all images will be put outside of 
	the database.
	- Application to be designed based on MVC pattern
	- Try to provide extra tools and options like webservices.
